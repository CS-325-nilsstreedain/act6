# Activity 6
You may work in groups with up to 3 students. When submitting solutions in Gradescope select a page for each problem and the students in your group.

## Written: (5 pts) The Wrestler Problem:
Suppose there are two types of professional wrestlers: “Babyfaces” (“good guys”) and “Heels” (“bad guys”). Between any pair of professional wrestlers, there may or may not be a rivalry. Suppose we have n wrestlers and we have a list of m pairs of rivalries.
1. Give a written description of an algorithm that determines whether it is possible to designate some of the wrestlers as Babyfaces and the remainder as Heels such that each rivalry is between a Babyface and a Heel. If it is possible output Possible otherwise output Impossible.
2. Give pseudocode for your algorithm
3. What is the running time of your algorithm?
## Code: (10 pts) Implement your algorithm for Babyfaces vs Heels in C++.
Input: The input contains the number of wrestlers, n (1,..,n) , followed by the number of rivalries m and rivalries listed in pairs, x y where 1 ≤ x, y ≤ n and x!=y.

Output: Results are outputted to the terminal.
- Possible or Impossible

### Sample:
Input:
```
4
4
1 2
1 3
4 2
4 3
```

Output:
```
Possible
